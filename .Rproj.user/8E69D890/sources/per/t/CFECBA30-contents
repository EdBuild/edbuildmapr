Description: Import US Census Bureau, Education Demographic and
   Geographic Estimates Program, Composite School District Boundaries
   Files for 2013-2017 with the option to attach EdBuild's master dataset of school district finance,
   student demographics, and community economic indicators for every school district in the United States.  
   The master dataset is built from the US Census, Annual Survey of School System Finances (F33)
   and joins data from the National Center for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data;
   the US Census, Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates; and the US Census,
   Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates. Additional functions in the package create a dataset
   of all school district neighbors as either a dataframe or a shapefile and maps of selected districts
   at the state or neighbor level symbolized by a selected variable in EdBuild's
   master dataset.
